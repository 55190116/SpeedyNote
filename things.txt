This somewhat works... 

OK, I guess this is the end of this port. I've somehow managed to port the python note taking app to c++ without knowing anything about c++. Huge thanks!



So let me conclude what my program currently has. 

1. Basic Notebook
1.1 Touch Sensitive Ink
1.2 Anti-Aliasing
1.3 Adjust thickness based on zoom level

2. Tools
2.1 Pen, Marker, Eraser
2.2 Adjustable thickness
2.3 Color presets and customizable colors

3. Pages
3.1 One picture per page 
3.2 Save notes and save annotated
3.3 Adjustable canvas size to fit the background
3.4 Adjustable zoom level
3.5 Correct range of x and y dimension sliders
3.6 Delete Page

4. PDF features
4.1 Loads PDF
4.2 Map every page to the PDF
4.3 PDF Cache of a reasonable size
4.4 Stores PDF directory persistently

5. MISC
5.1 Sample rate benchmarking

For future, what are you recommendations if I need to finish it in 4 days (maybe slightly longer), (with a few hours per day, because I take 7 courses per semester)?

The things I can come up with are... 

1. Tabs, like the ones on a browser. It's like opening a few canvases like opening several instances of the program, for quick switching between documents
2. A rope tool. This lets the user select an arbitrary shape and range of stuff on the canvas and move/scale it all around the canvas.
3. A pencil. Pressure of the pencil not only adjusts the thickness, it also adjusts the texture/opacity. I may even consider using the tilt sensor of wacom emr 2.0 on 2017+ devices. 
4. Text boxes (to annotate a pdf). Just in case the user wants to type in text instead of writing them by hand. My program probably needs another layer for text. 
5. An icon and a nice name for my app. 

The things I don't think make much sense are :
1. Cloud syncing. If I position the notebook folder inside the onedrive directory of windows file manager, onedrive automatically does the job. 
I don't need to modify my app at all to support cloud syncing. 

Which one do you think is the most practical while doesn't need any major reconstruction of my program?
